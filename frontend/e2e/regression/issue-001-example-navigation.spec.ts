  /**
   * GitHub Issue: https://github.com/jclee-homelab/blacklist/issues/1
   *
   * PROBLEM:
   * Navigation links were not clickable immediately after page load due to
   * hydration delay. Users had to wait several seconds before the nav worked.
   *
   * ROOT CAUSE:
   * React hydration was blocking event handlers on navigation links.
   * The links appeared clickable but click events were not registered.
   *
   * FIX:
   * Added proper loading states and ensured navigation is interactive
   * before hydration completes using Next.js Link component correctly.
   *
   * REGRESSION PREVENTION:
   * This test verifies that navigation works immediately after page load.
